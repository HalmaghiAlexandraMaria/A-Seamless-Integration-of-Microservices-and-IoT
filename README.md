# A-Seamless-Integration-of-Microservices-and-IoT
The project combines microservices development with IoT, creating a client-server application that collects and provides data from sensors via HTTP/HTTPS and MQTT. Sensors are simulated in a Docker container, and the application, accessed through curl, connects to the broker to retrieve requested data.
